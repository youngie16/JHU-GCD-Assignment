STUDY DESIGN <<as described in original features_info and original Readme>>


The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. 
Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. 
Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. 
The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset was randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the 
training data and 30% the test data. 

======================================================================================================================================

ASSIGNMENT SPECIFICATION

You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.


=======================================================================================================================================

BACKGROUND INFORMATION : Initial "Raw" Data <Inertial signals>

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). 
The signals for each different subject/activity/window (128 readings/values) are contained in 18 files (9 each for test and train)
separately for body acceleration, total acceleration and body gyropscope readings and then separately for each of those in the x,y,z axis and named as follows:

- body_acc_[x/y/z]_[train/test]    The body acceleration signal obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration in standard gravity units 'g'. Every row shows a 128 element vector. 
- body_gyro_[x/y/z]_[train/test]   The angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample. The units are radians/second.  Every row shows a 128 element vector. 
- total_acc_[x/y/z]_[train/test]   The acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X axis in standard gravity units 'g'. Every row shows a 128 element vector.

 This data was not used as part of the assignment as it had already been processed as per below.

=======================================================================================================================================

BACKGROUND INFORMATION: Initial Processed Data

The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. 
The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. 
From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details. 

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. 
These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. 
Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. 
Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another 
low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

tBodyAcc-XYZ
tGravityAcc-XYZ
tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
tBodyGyro-XYZ
tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
tBodyAccMag
tGravityAccMag
tBodyAccJerkMag
tBodyGyroMag
tBodyGyroJerkMag
fBodyAcc-XYZ
fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
fBodyGyro-XYZ
fBodyAccMag
fBodyAccJerkMag
fBodyGyroMag
fBodyGyroJerkMag

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 

mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation
mad(): Median absolute deviation 
max(): Largest value in array
min(): Smallest value in array
sma(): Signal magnitude area
energy(): Energy measure. Sum of the squares divided by the number of values. 
iqr(): Interquartile range 
entropy(): Signal entropy
arCoeff(): Autorregresion coefficients with Burg order equal to 4
correlation(): correlation coefficient between two signals
maxInds(): index of the frequency component with largest magnitude
meanFreq(): Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency
skewness(): skewness of the frequency domain signal 
kurtosis(): kurtosis of the frequency domain signal 
bandsEnergy(): Energy of a frequency interval within the 64 bins of the FFT of each window.
angle(): Angle between to vectors.

Additional vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample. These are used on the angle() variable:

gravityMean
tBodyAccMean
tBodyAccJerkMean
tBodyGyroMean
tBodyGyroJerkMean

The complete list of variables of each feature vector is available in 'features.txt'

The observations and 561 variables are contained in the files  X_test/train
The subjects matching each observation in X_test/train are contained in the files Subject_test/train
The activities matching each obsevation in X_test/train are contained in the files y_test/train
=======================================================================================================================================

FINAL PROCESSED DATA: Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones - summarised assignment data 09Dec2016.csv

For each of  X_test/train subjects the 561 variables described above were matched with their subject and activity
those variables that related to a mean or standard deviation were then extracted (note that I included the meanFreq variables as erring on the side of caution,
they could always be deleted if not needed later) - a total of 86 measurement variables plus 2 identifying variables (subject and activity)

An average of the observations accross the 86 measurement variables was then taken separately for each activity by each subject (giving 180 observations ie 6 x 30)

The final variables are listed below  :

Units:
- TimeBodyAcc and TimeGravityAcc are in standard gravity units "g"
- TimeBodyGyro are in radians/second
- Features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1].

Columns could be arranged better to provide more tidy data - but couldn't see how to do easily and lacked the enthusiasm at this stage of the assignment
